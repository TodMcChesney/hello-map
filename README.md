# Hello Map App

This project is for the 'Getting Started with the APIs' Udacity course.

## Getting Started

First clone or download the repo to your local computer. Then to get the
project up and running for development and testing you will need to
setup gulp.

### Requires
- Node.js
- gulp-cli (installed globally)

### Install
From the command line in the root project folder run:

```$ npm install```

This will install gulp locally with all the necessary modules.

### Running Dev Environment

```$ gulp```

This task spins up a localhost server, and watches all files for changes
. BrowserSync automatically opens the index.html page and refreshes
the site after any changes are saved.
